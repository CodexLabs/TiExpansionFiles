# Ti Expansion Files Android Module

The Titanium Expansion Files module allows taking advantage of the [APK Expansion Files](http://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html) feature provided by the Android Play Store in Titanium Mobile applications.

The module uses Google's Licensing and Downloader libraries distributed as Extras within the Android SDK install.

    * `downloader_library`: the Google Downloader library source code and .jar
    * `licensing_library`: the Google Licensing library source code and .jar
    * `tiexpansionfiles`: the Titanium/Android native module
    * `tiexpansiontest`: a Titanium mobile (classic) test application

For additional information on the module, please refer to the `README.md` file contained in the `tiexpansionfiles` project directory.
